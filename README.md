# Parish Bulletin Harvester v2

**👉 New here? Start with [WHAT_IS_THIS.md](WHAT_IS_THIS.md).**

Downloads weekly Catholic parish bulletins by calculating URLs from known patterns,
then stitches them into one A–Z mega PDF.

## Audits

- [Deep audit — 22/05/2026](docs/audit/2026-05-22-deep-audit.md)

## How it works

1. **Evidence file** (`parishes/{diocese}_bulletin_urls.txt`) records real, manually
   verified bulletin URLs for every parish.
2. The harvester **reads the evidence file** and first uses date maths to predict
   this week's URL for each parish.
3. If `parishes/recipes/{parish_key}.json` exists, Playwright replays those
   recorded steps first (training recipe mode). If replay fails, the parish is
   marked as an error for that run — the harvester does **not** fall back to the
   generic prediction/scraping flow when a recipe is present.
4. If no recipe exists, Playwright opens the parish page,
   scans links/embeds/iframes, and downloads the best PDF/DOCX match.
5. All PDFs are **stitched into one mega PDF** (A–Z). HTML-only parishes get a
   clickable link page instead.

**Prediction first, page scraping fallback. No AI verifier.**

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Run

```bash
# Full run for Derry Diocese (auto-calculates this week's Sunday)
python main.py

# Specify a diocese or date
python main.py --diocese derry_diocese --target-date 2026-04-19

# Fetch only (no report or mega PDF)
python main.py --dry-run

# Train a parish recipe (interactive browser)
python main.py --train "Hannahstown"
# or
python train.py "Hannahstown"
```

Training mode now uses a Chrome extension floating toolbar so you can mark:
- static HTML bulletin pages (**Mark Page as HTML**),
- the current URL as a bulletin file (**Mark Current URL as File**),
- image bulletins (right-click an image → **Mark as Bulletin Image**),
- image regions to convert to PDF (**Crop Bulletin Image** — scroll with the mouse wheel or drag near the edge while cropping to capture content that extends below the fold).

The fetcher also auto-detects WordPress PDF Embedder links (`a.pdfemb-viewer`) and prefers those URLs first.

---

## Private Chrome/Brave Extension (Operator Workflow)

You can load the extension privately and use it without running `train.py`.

### Install as unpacked extension

1. Open `chrome://extensions` (or `brave://extensions`).
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the repository folder: `extension/`.
5. Pin **Parish Trainer** to your toolbar.

The extension now opens a popup by default, and you can launch the full operator console from there.

### Optional: self-hosted auto-update channel (no reinstall)

The repo now publishes:
- `https://frankytyrone.github.io/parish_harvester/extension/parish_trainer.zip`
- `https://frankytyrone.github.io/parish_harvester/updates.xml`

and `extension/manifest.json` includes:

```json
"update_url": "https://frankytyrone.github.io/parish_harvester/updates.xml"
```

`deploy-pages.yml` rebuilds and republishes these on every `main` push that changes `extension/**`.
Set repository variable `CHROME_EXTENSION_APP_ID` to your extension ID so `updates.xml` targets the correct app.

### Popup vs Toolbar vs Operator Console

- **Popup**: quick launcher for page-level actions (show toolbar, mark current page/file/html).
- **Floating Toolbar**: in-page controls for click/crop/image/manual page interaction.
- **Operator Console**: parish-level operations (manual override 📌/clear 🧹, mega-PDF skip, evidence edits, GitHub settings).

### One-time GitHub setup (for standalone save/push)

1. Click the extension icon.
2. Click **Open Operator Console**.
3. In **GitHub Settings**, enter:
   - Personal Access Token (`repo` scope)
   - Repository in `owner/repo` format (for example `Frankytyrone/parish_harvester`)
4. Save settings.

### Manual on-the-fly bulletin / mega-PDF override

Use this when automation picks an old or unrelated PDF.

1. Open the correct bulletin document (or bulletin page) in the active tab.
2. Open **Operator Console** → **Parish Directory**.
3. Find the parish row and click **📌**.
   - This saves the active tab URL to `parishes/manual_overrides.json`.
   - It is pushed directly to GitHub from the extension.
4. (Optional) Click **☑ skip** if you want to exclude that parish from this week's mega PDF (`parishes/mega_excludes.json`).
5. Click **🧹** to clear a parish override when it is no longer needed.

### Troubleshooting: "Could not communicate with page"

If popup/console page actions fail:

1. Confirm the active tab is a regular `http://` or `https://` page (not `chrome://`, `brave://`, extension pages, or browser settings pages).
2. Refresh the target page once, then retry **Show Toolbar**.
3. Retry from the popup; the extension now auto-reinits its page scripts on demand when possible.
4. If the page still cannot be scripted, use **Operator Console** parish-level override (`📌`) from a known-good bulletin URL tab.

### How overrides are consumed by the harvester

During `python main.py` fetches, `parishes/manual_overrides.json` is loaded first.

Precedence is deterministic:
1. **Manual override URL** (operator-confirmed)
2. Trained recipe replay (`parishes/recipes/*.json`)
3. Pattern prediction + scraper fallback

So operator-confirmed bulletin URLs always get first attempt before automation guesses.

## Guided Mode Training

The Parish Trainer extension includes **Guided Mode** (on by default) to make training as simple as possible.

### How it works

When you open a parish page during training, the floating toolbar automatically appears and presents a simple 3-choice wizard:

**What do you see on screen?**

| Choice | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| 📄 Get a PDF (recommended) | Validates the current URL looks like a document, then records it as the bulletin file URL. Non-document URLs require an explicit "Mark Anyway" confirmation. |
| 🖼️ Get an image (newsletter screenshot) | Hides the toolbar and opens the crop tool — draw a rectangle around the bulletin. **Scroll with the mouse wheel while the crop overlay is open. Drag near the top or bottom edge to auto-scroll.** Use **Add More** to stitch multiple sections into one. |
| 🔗 I need to click something first | Enters **Pick Link Mode**: hover over any link to highlight it, click to select it. Shows a confirmation step with "Looks right / Pick again" before recording. |

### Other features

Click **"I'm stuck — show all options"** (below the 3 buttons) or **"⚙️ Advanced / More options"** to reveal:

- **📐 It's in a frame / viewer** — Opens the **Iframe Picker**: lists all iframes on the page, automatically unwraps Google Docs viewer URLs, and marks the resolved PDF URL.
- **📰 Capture newsletter column (auto)** — Highlights the main article/content column (detects `article`, `.entry-content`, etc.) and shows a status message so you can crop it accurately.
- **🔍 Help me identify this page** — Runs lightweight detection and explains what type of page you are on. Correctly identifies:
  - Direct PDF pages
  - **WordPress PDF Embedder pages** (`a.pdfemb-viewer` links) — shown as "PDF listing page" not "HTML only"
  - Embedded PDF iframes (including Google Docs viewer)
  - `<embed>`/`<object>` PDF elements
  - Generic PDF/DOCX links (ranks weekly-bulletin-looking links first)
  - Image bulletins
  - HTML-only pages
- **🎯 Pick newest bulletin** — appears automatically after identification when PDF Embedder or PDF links are found. Scores links by date and picks the most recent one for you to confirm.
- **🕵️ Deep Detect (10 s)** — appears for HTML/unknown/embed pages. Patches `XMLHttpRequest` and `fetch` for 10 seconds and watches `PerformanceObserver`, then lists any PDF/DOCX URLs it detected in the background. Useful when the PDF loads hidden behind a viewer plugin.
- **Mark Page as HTML** — records this page as an HTML-only bulletin (kept for edge cases).
- **📋 Recipe Preview** — shows all recorded steps for the current session. Click the header to expand it.
- **↩ Undo Last Step** — removes the most recently recorded step from both the UI and the training session.

### Safety checks

Before recording a URL as a bulletin file, the toolbar checks whether it looks like a document (PDF, DOCX, Google Drive file). If not, a warning is shown with an explicit "⚠️ Mark Anyway" confirmation button, preventing accidental recording of generic HTML listing pages.

---

## New Features

### 1. Error Notifications in the Floating Toolbar

The floating Parish Trainer toolbar now shows a small coloured status bar below the buttons:
- ✅ **Green bar** — action succeeded (e.g. "✅ Marked as HTML")
- ❌ **Red bar** — action failed (e.g. "❌ Could not communicate with page. Try refreshing.")

The message auto-hides after 4 seconds.

### 2. Retry Logic

When a PDF download fails (network error, timeout, bad response), the harvester
automatically retries up to **2 more times** (3 total attempts) with a 3-second
wait between attempts. Each retry is logged to the terminal:

```
↩️ Retrying ardmoreparish (attempt 2/3): HTTP 503 for https://...
↩️ Retrying ardmoreparish (attempt 3/3): HTTP 503 for https://...
```

### 3. Harvest Log / History

Every harvest run appends results to `harvest_log.json` in the project root. At
the end of each run, a summary table of the last 20 harvests is printed:

```
── Harvest Log (last 20) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 Parish                 │ Status │ Type    │ Timestamp           │ Error / URL
────────────────────────┼────────┼─────────┼─────────────────────┼──────────────
 Ardmore Parish         │ ✅ ok   │ pdf     │ 2026-04-20T08:00:00 │ https://...
 Clonleigh Parish       │ 💥 fail │         │ 2026-04-20T08:01:12 │ HTTP 404
```

The log file is cumulative — it grows over time and lets you see trends in which
parishes fail regularly.

### 4. iFrame PDF Detection

The bulletin scraper now specifically checks `iframe[src]` elements before
falling back to generic link scanning:
- If the iframe `src` ends in `.pdf` or contains `.pdf`, it is treated as a
  direct PDF URL and downloaded immediately.
- If the `src` is a Google Docs viewer URL (`docs.google.com/viewer?url=…`), the
  real PDF URL is extracted from the `url=` query parameter automatically.

This covers parishes that embed their bulletin PDF inside an `<iframe>` on their
website (a common WordPress pattern).

### 5. Automatic Scheduled Harvesting

Run the harvester automatically every week without manual intervention:

```bash
python scheduler.py
```

By default this runs the full harvest every **Sunday at 08:00**. The schedule is
configurable via environment variables — no code changes required:

```bash
# Run every Sunday at 10:30 instead
HARVEST_SCHEDULE="sunday 10:30" python scheduler.py

# Run on a different day
HARVEST_SCHEDULE="monday 06:00" python scheduler.py

# Use a different diocese
HARVEST_DIOCESE="armagh_diocese" python scheduler.py
```

**Cost: zero.** Uses only the lightweight [`schedule`](https://pypi.org/project/schedule/)
pip package (already in `requirements.txt`) and Python built-ins. No cloud
services, no subscriptions, no cron daemon required — just leave the terminal
running.

To run it in the background on Linux/macOS:

```bash
nohup python scheduler.py &> scheduler.log &
```

## URL Patterns

| Pattern | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| A | `DDMMYY` | `.../pdf/120426.pdf` |
| B | `D-M-YY` | `.../onewebmedia/5-4-26.pdf` |
| C | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `.../uploads/2026/04/2026-04-12.pdf` |
| D | `DD-Month-YYYY` | `.../Newsletter-12-April-2026-1.pdf` |
| E | `[YYYY-M-D]` | `...[2026-4-12].pdf` |
| F | Static URL | same URL overwritten every week |
| H | Sequential number | `.../Newsletters/384/Bulletin-...` |
| clonleigh | WP post (Saturday before Sunday) | `.../2026/04/11/strabane-...-12th-april-2026/` |
| greenlough | Liturgical name + `[YYYY-M-D]` | `...Palm_Sunday[2026-3-29].pdf` |
| html\_link | No PDF — link only in mega PDF | `melmountparish.com/parishnews.html` |
| image | JPEG/PNG → PDF (via Pillow) | `iskaheenparish.com/.../1.jpg` |
| docx | Word doc → PDF (via LibreOffice) | `parishofclaudy.com/NEWSLETTER 12-4-26.docx` |

---

## Target Date Logic

The harvester calculates the target Sunday automatically:

| Day run | Target |
|---------|--------|
| Sunday | Today |
| Monday–Saturday | Last Sunday |

Override with `--target-date YYYY-MM-DD`.

---

## Adding a New Diocese

See `parishes/NEW_DIOCESE_TEMPLATE.md` for a complete guide.

Short version:
1. Create `parishes/{name}_bulletin_urls.txt` with real bulletin URLs
2. Create `parishes/{name}_contacts.json` with display names (optional)
3. Run `python main.py --diocese {name}`

---

## Output

After each run:

- `Bulletins/current/` — downloaded bulletin PDFs
- `Bulletins/all_bulletins_{date}.pdf` — merged A–Z mega PDF
- `Bulletins/report.json` — machine-readable report
- `Bulletins/report.txt` — human-readable report
- `harvest_log.json` — cumulative harvest history (all runs)

### report.json structure

```json
{
  "target_date": "2026-04-19",
  "summary": {
    "downloaded": 25,
    "html_links": 4,
    "failed": 2
  },
  "downloaded": [...],
  "html_links": [...],
  "failed": [...]
}
```

---

## GitHub Actions

The workflow runs every Sunday at 12:00 UTC and:
1. Downloads all bulletins
2. Creates the mega PDF
3. Posts a summary issue to the repository
4. Uploads the Bulletins folder as an artifact

---

## Email Notifications

The harvester can send an email summary after each harvest. This is optional — if `HARVEST_EMAIL_TO` is not set, the harvester runs normally without sending any email.

### Quick setup

```bash
export HARVEST_EMAIL_TO="your-email@example.com"
export SMTP_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
export SMTP_PORT="587"
export SMTP_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
export SMTP_PASSWORD="your-app-password"   # Gmail: use an App Password
```

### Email providers

| Provider | Environment variables required |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| **SMTP** (default) | `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD` |
| **SendGrid** | `EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid`, `SENDGRID_API_KEY` |
| **Mailgun** | `EMAIL_PROVIDER=mailgun`, `MAILGUN_API_KEY`, `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` |

Set `HARVEST_EMAIL_FROM` to customise the sender address (optional).

### GitHub Actions setup

Add repository secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `HARVEST_EMAIL_TO` | Recipient email address |
| `HARVEST_EMAIL_FROM` | Sender address (optional) |
| `EMAIL_PROVIDER` | `smtp` (default), `sendgrid`, or `mailgun` |
| `SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server (e.g. `smtp.gmail.com`) |
| `SMTP_PORT` | SMTP port (e.g. `587`) |
| `SMTP_USER` | SMTP username |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | SMTP password / app password |
| `SENDGRID_API_KEY` | SendGrid API key (if using SendGrid) |
| `MAILGUN_API_KEY` | Mailgun API key (if using Mailgun) |
| `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` | Mailgun sending domain (if using Mailgun) |

The harvest workflow already passes these secrets to the harvester automatically.
